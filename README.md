# whether

Introducing whether, the home automation tool of the future. With its state of the art technology, whether is able to tell a user the current weather in their area. Has science gone too far?

## Usage

Get an Arduino with a temperature sensor and an LCD-text display screen. Put the temperature sensor on the analog input pin 0. Also manage to find the random dependencies peter forgot to add. Then run the code and you'll have the weather in no time!
